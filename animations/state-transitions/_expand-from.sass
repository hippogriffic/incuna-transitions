// Can be used to animate hidden content that appears on click / hover so
// that it appears to be expanding from a specific point of origin

// Arguments:
// axis = x (horizontal), y (vertical), both
// duration = time in s or ms
// timing-function = ease, ease-in, linear, cubic-bezier, etc.
// iteration-count = integer, infinite (how many times should the animation be played)
// origin = transform-origin property, top, left, center, if axis is set to both origin
//     can be up to 2 values (top left, bottom center, etc.)

// A note about origin:
// expand from, shrink to
// So expand-from with `$origin: top` expands from the top to the bottom,
// shrink-to with `$origin: top` shrinks to the top from the bottom.

// Can be paired with shrink-to mixin to expand and then shrink content when classes are added
// .element
//     .expand-class
//         @include expand(y, 1s, ease, 1, top)
//     .shrink-class
//         @include shrink(y, 1s, ease, 1, top)
// Will create an element that expands from the top when .expand-class is added
// and then shrink back to the top when .shrink-class is added
